# HOW TO WRITE A GIT COMMIT MESSAGE (https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit):
#
#    1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    2. Limit the subject line to 50 chars (EDIT: I limit the subject to 80)
#    3. Capitalize the subject line
#    4. Do not end the subject line with a period
#    5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    6. Wrap the body at 72 characters (EDIT: I wrap the body at 80)
#    7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
