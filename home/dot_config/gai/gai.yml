      Can you help me enforce the AAA (arrange, act, assert) test method structure? In particular, find and fix Any test
      method modified by this CL that does NOT structure its statements using the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern. There
      should NEVER be a blank line that breaks up one of these sections. Use comments if necessary to separate different
      parts of each section, but NEVER specify the section name using a comment (ex: '# Act'). When no section has more
      than 1 top-level (ex: not nested in a lambda expression block) statement, no blank lines are necessary. Otherwise,
      the sections should ALWAYS be separated by a blank line.
