      - mentor_name: comments
        prompt: |
          Can you help me ensure that all code changes in this CL follow best practices for code comments? Specifically,
          ensure that:
            + All public fields, functions, classes, and methods have clear and concise doc comments that follow best
              practices for the language they are written in. EXCEPTIONS:
                - Getters and setters do not need doc comments unless they have non-trivial logic.
                - If the best you can do is restate the name of the field, function, class, or method in the comment, then
                  no comment is necessary.
            + We are critical about the comments we add — avoid redundant comments that simply restate what the code does.
      - mentor_name: shared_code
        prompt: |
          Can you help me identify any code that is duplicated across multiple files in this CL? You should use your
          CodeSearch tool to search for duplication and/or existing shared utilities across the codebase (related to the
          changes made in this CL). If you find any, please refactor the code to factor out a new shared utility / use the
          existing shared utility.
      - mentor_name: sound_tests
        run_on_wip: true
        prompt: |
          Can you help me ensure that the changes made in this CL have proper test coverage? Specifically, you should
          verify that:
            + New logic comes with new or strengthened tests (or a clear justification for why existing tests are
              sufficient).
            + in the case of bug fixes, regressions are actively guarded against, not "accidentally avoided": include at
              least one test that would have failed before the change.
      - mentor_name: symbol_names
        prompt: |
          Can you help me ensure that all classes, methods, functions, variables, and fields modified by this CL have clear
          and descriptive names that follow best practices for the language they are written in?
      - mentor_name: vision
        prompt: |
          Can you help me check all code modified by this CL to ensure that the visibility modifiers (ex: public / private /
          protected for Java or just a leading underscore for private Dart symbols) of all classes, methods, and fields
          modified in this CL are appropriate? Make sure that no class, method, or field is more visible than it needs to
          be. For example, if a method is only used within its own class, it should be marked as private instead of public
          or protected. Dead code (unused public functionality that was added by this CL) should also be removed.

        prompt: |
          Can you help me ensure that all user-facing strings introduced or modified in this CL are properly
          internationalized? Make sure that we favor performing internationalization directly in templates (see
          @third_party/dart_src/angular/g3doc/dev/i18n.md) instead of in Dart code files for short, simple strings.

          Can you help me ensure that this feature is functonally complete based off of the CL description (shown in the
          CL description file below){{ chat_clause }} and the file changes that have been made so far (shown in the diff file below)? Do
          NOT consider test completeness (we have other mentors for that).

        prompt: |
          Can you help me enforce the AAA (arrange, act, assert) test method structure? In particular, find and fix Any test
          method modified by this CL that does NOT structure its statements using the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern. There
          should NEVER be a blank line that breaks up one of these sections. Use comments if necessary to separate different
          parts of each section, but NEVER specify the section name using a comment (ex: '# Act'). When no section has more
          than 1 top-level (ex: not nested in a lambda expression block) statement, no blank lines are necessary. Otherwise,
          the sections should ALWAYS be separated by a blank line.
