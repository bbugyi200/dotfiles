          I need to add a new line chart to the PA troubleshooting page on (for Google Ad Manager's FE). We need to make sure
          we only make one RPC to populate the data for the line chart and we have decided to use the OnePlatform Reporting
          API to accomplish this. Can you help me do some research on how the OnePlatform Reporting API works?

          currently using the OnePlatform Reporting API? Bonus points if you can find any that are using the dimensions we
          need!

          from the OnePlatform Reporting API?

  # Step 2: Implementation agent executes the plan
  - name: implementation
    prompt: |
      Can you help me improve the PA troubleshooting page by adding a line chart view in addition to the existing pie
      chart view?

      - We shouldn't show the pie chart and the line chart at the same time ever. So make sure the user has a way to
        toggle between the two.
      - This code lives somewhere in the
        contentads/drx/fe/client/trafficking/private_marketplace/components/deal_check_ui/ directory.
      - This functionality should all be gated behind the ENABLE_PA_TROUBLESHOOTING_IMPROVEMENTS #feat.

      Here is the research gathered from 3 parallel agents:

      ## Your Task
      Please create a thorough implementation plan for this feature and then implement it.
