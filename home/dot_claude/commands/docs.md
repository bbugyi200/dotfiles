description: Review and improve project documentation
---

Can you help me review the documentation in the README.md file and in the markdown files contained in the docs/
directory? Namely:

- Ensure that all documentation is up to date and accurate.
- Look for gaps in the documentation. For example, should we add a new section to the README.md file? Should new docs/
  markdown files be created?
- Review git commits since the last documentation update to identify any important changes worth documenting.

When you have completed the review, please improve the documentation as needed.
