description: Create beads for every phase in a plan file under a new epic
argument-hint: <plan_file_path>

Can you help me create one bead for every phase in the @$1 plan file? These beads should all be children of a new epic
bead that you should also create. Make sure that each phase bead has the appropriate dependencies set up. I'll let you
decide how many phases are needed, but keep in mind that each phase will be executed by a distinct Claude Code instance.
