description: Create beads for every phase in a plan file under a new epic
argument-hint: <plan_file_path>

Can you help me create one bead for every phase in the @$1 plan file? These beads should all be children of a new epic
bead that you should also create. Make sure that each phase bead has the appropriate dependencies set up.
