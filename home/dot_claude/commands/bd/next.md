description: Claim an available bead and start working on it
---

Can you run the `bd ready` command to see which beads are ready to be worked, claim the next ready bead by marking it as
in-progress, complete the work associated with it, and then close the bead (do NOT close the parent epic bead)? Make
sure to mark the bead as in-progress before you start planning.
