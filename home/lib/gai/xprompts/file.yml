      ### File Output Requirements

      You MUST write your complete response to the following file: bb/gai/file/{{ name }}.md

      IMPORTANT: The file MUST contain your full response as markdown Do NOT skip writing to the file--this is a
      required step.

  - name: verify_file
    hidden: true
    bash: |
      file_path="bb/gai/file/{{ name }}.md"
      if [ ! -f "$file_path" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: Expected file '$file_path' was not created by the agent" >&2
        exit 1
      fi
      if [ ! -s "$file_path" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: File '$file_path' exists but is empty" >&2
        exit 1
      fi
      echo "file_path=$file_path"
    output: { file_path: path }
