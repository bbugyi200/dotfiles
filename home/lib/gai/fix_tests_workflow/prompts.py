- You MUST follow the todo list in @{artifacts_dir}/editor_todos.md EXACTLY as specified.
- Complete each todo item in the exact sequence provided.
- Mark each todo as COMPLETED by changing `- [ ]` to `- [X]` IMMEDIATELY after completing it.
- Do NOT skip any todos - ALL must be completed.
- You should make code changes to fix the failing test, but do NOT run the test command yourself.
- Do NOT run any validation commands like `hg fix` - the verification agent will handle syntax checking.

- Confirm you've read the todo list.
- Explain the specific changes you made for each todo.

editor agent made a reasonable attempt at each todo item.

# CRITICAL - Only reject changes for these SERIOUS issues:
1. SYNTAX ERRORS: Code that breaks compilation/parsing (obvious syntax issues visible in diff).
2. COMPLETELY MISSED TODOS: Editor agent didn't even attempt a todo item (and didn't report todo issues).
3. NO CHANGES MADE: Editor agent made no code changes at all (empty diff file) and didn't report todo issues.

# DO NOT reject for:
- Imperfect implementations (as long as some attempt was made).
- Different approaches than you would take.
- Minor style issues or missing edge cases.
- Incomplete solutions (partial progress is acceptable).

# AVAILABLE FILES TO REVIEW:
@{artifacts_dir}/editor_todos.md - The todo list the editor was supposed to follow.
@{artifacts_dir}/agent_reply.md - The editor agent's response about what they did.
@{artifacts_dir}/editor_iter_{iteration}_changes.diff - The actual code changes made by the editor.

# VERIFICATION PROCESS:
1. First, check if editor agent reported problems with the todos themselves - if so, FIX THE TODOS and FAIL (so editor retries with improved todos).
2. Check if diff file is empty - FAIL if no changes were made and no todo issues reported.
3. Visually inspect code changes for obvious syntax errors - FAIL if any found.
4. Check each todo item was attempted (not necessarily perfectly) - FAIL if completely ignored without explanation.
5. If all pass, always PASS regardless of implementation quality.

# YOUR RESPONSE MUST END WITH:
- "VERIFICATION: PASS" if changes were made AND no syntax errors AND all todos were attempted.
- "VERIFICATION: FAIL" if todos were fixed OR no changes made OR syntax errors exist OR any todos were completely ignored.

BE LENIENT: If the editor made any reasonable attempt at a todo, count it as attempted. If editor reports todo problems, fix the todos and then FAIL so the editor can retry with improved instructions.

    prompt = f"""You are a research and analysis agent (iteration {iteration}). Your goal is to analyze the test
failure and create a comprehensive todo list for the next editor agent.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
- Create todo items that instruct the editor agent to make actual fixes to underlying issues.
- Focus on root cause analysis and proper code modifications.
- Address bugs, API changes, implementation issues, or infrastructure problems.
- Avoid simple workarounds - aim for genuine fixes that resolve the test failures.

# editor_todos.md FILE INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST always create an editor_todos.md file - there is no option to skip this step.
- Focus on creating actionable, specific todo items that will guide the editor agent to fix the test.
- NEVER recommend that editor agents run test commands - the workflow handles all test execution automatically.
- Each todo item must be completely self-contained with full context.

# NOTES ABOUT THE EDITOR AGENT:
- The editor agent can ONLY see the todo list you create.
- You MUST include ALL necessary context and instructions directly in the todo list.
- Do NOT reference previous agent responses or assume the editor knows what was tried before.

# AVAILABLE CONTEXT FILES:
@{artifacts_dir}/cl_changes.diff - Current CL changes (branch_diff output).
@{artifacts_dir}/cl_desc.txt - Current CL description (hdesc output).
@{artifacts_dir}/test_output.txt - Original test failure output.

# IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR ANALYSIS:
- Remember that updating non-test code is EXPECTED and appropriate when it fixes test failures.
- Editor agents should modify ANY code necessary (production code, config, dependencies, etc.) to make tests pass.
- UNACCEPTABLE changes: Removing new fields/features the CL adds just to make tests pass.
- ACCEPTABLE changes: Bug fixes, API updates, implementation changes, infrastructure fixes.

# COMMON TEST FAILURE PATTERNS:
- NEW TESTS that never passed: Often test framework, setup, or dependency issues.
- EXISTING TESTS broken by CL: Usually legitimate bugs that need fixing in the code.
- UPSTREAM INFRASTRUCTURE failures: Need to be tracked down and resolved at the root cause.
- Tests expecting old behavior: May need test updates if new behavior is correct.

# YOUR TASK:
1. RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS:
   - Analyze the latest test failure and editor attempt.
   - THOROUGHLY REVIEW all historical iteration files to identify patterns and avoid repetition.
   - Research relevant information using available tools (code search, Moma search, CL search, etc.).
   - Your response will be saved for future research agents to reference.

2. TODO LIST CREATION:
   - Create a comprehensive todo list: {artifacts_dir}/editor_todos.md.
   - Include ONLY specific code changes that need to be made (no investigation or analysis tasks).
   - Each todo should specify exactly what code change to make and in which file.
   - Order tasks logically - verification agent will handle syntax validation.

# editor_todos.md FILE FORMAT:
Create {artifacts_dir}/editor_todos.md with the following structure:
- [ ] [specific code change needed in file X]
- [ ] [specific fix to apply in file Y]
- [ ] [specific modification to implement in file Z]

# IMPORTANT: 
- Include ONLY concrete code changes that need to be made.
- Do NOT include investigation, analysis, or research tasks.
- Do NOT include validation tasks - the verification agent handles syntax checking.
- Each todo should specify exactly what code change to make and in which file.
- The research agent has already done all investigation - editor just needs to implement.
- Each todo must be COMPLETELY SELF-CONTAINED with full context since editor has no access to previous iterations.
- Include file paths, line numbers, exact code snippets, and detailed explanations in each todo item.
- Do NOT assume the editor knows anything about previous attempts or failures
- Focus on todos that make actual fixes to the underlying issues.
- Address root causes rather than symptoms.
- Make comprehensive fixes that resolve the test failures properly.

# RESPONSE FORMAT:
Provide a summary of:
1. Research findings and analysis from reviewing the test failure and previous iterations.
2. Key insights discovered that inform your approach.
3. The approach taken in the new editor_todos.md file.
4. How this todo list differs from previous attempts."""
