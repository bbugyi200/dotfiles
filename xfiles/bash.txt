# I consider these scripts to all be good examples of bash scripts that make good use of the bugyi.sh library. Take
# note of how the run() functions are used in these scripts! Also, keep in mind that thesse scripts are transformed by
# chezmoi into executables of the same name but without the "executable_" prefix.
