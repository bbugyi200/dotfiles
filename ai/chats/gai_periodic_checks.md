I want you to help me generate a prompt for a different LLM by summarizing the train of thought that I'm about to give to you. Starting now. So, can you help me change the triggers that we're currently using to check whether or not a CL has been mailed, or I'm sorry, whether or not a CL has been submitted or not. Right now, we're only checking the mailed CLs that are loaded by Guy, which is spelled G-A-I, lowercase, and when using the next or previous options. Instead, I want to trigger for all mailed CLs across all projects, regardless of whether or not they match our filters. Every time that we load up Guy work, which is a command, G-A-I work. And also, every time we hit next or previous, it should check every mailed CL that meets our previous specifications, which I haven't told you yet, which are every CL is only checked once every five minutes, and it's only checked if it either doesn't have a parent or its parent CL is submitted. We need to do this in an optimized way so we're not experiencing a long lag every time we go from one change spec to the next.

Okay, great. On to the next prompt. You can assume that I am passing this next prompt to the same LLM that has access to all the same content and the previous prompt. The next thing I want to do is start checking for more things than just whether or not the CL is submitted or not. I also want to check whether or not any comments have been left by reviewers. So it's going to check for comments in response to the same triggers and at the same periodic intervals every five minutes and only when it doesn't have a parent CL or the parent CL is submitted. And it will use a tool called critique underscore comment, which it will run with an argument that is a single word. It will use the value of the change spec name field to populate this argument for the critique underscore comment command. If this command has any output, it means that the CL has comments that I need to respond to. In that case, we should change the status of the change spec from mailed to a new status that we need to add support for that's called changes requested.

Great. Now for the next prompt. Make sure that every time we sync, we, um... Refresh the list of change specs that the GAI work command is iterating over. And also, we want to change the Y option, which is used to sync the current change spec currently, to instead initiate the sync process for all matched change specs. So all mailed change spec with either no parents or submitted parents that haven't been checked in the last five minutes. This option, too, should update the list of change spec we're iterating over.
