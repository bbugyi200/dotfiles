description: Clean up a bash script using the bugyi.sh library and best practices
argument-hint: <bash-script>

ultrathink: Can you help me clean this script up by using the home/lib/bugyi.sh library and following some best practices
demonstrated by the scripts below?

Script to clean up: `$1`

I consider these scripts to all be good examples of bash scripts that make good use of the bugyi.sh library. Take note
of how the run() functions are used in these scripts!:

- home/bin/executable_hourly_bam
- home/bin/executable_bug_new
- home/bin/executable_copando
